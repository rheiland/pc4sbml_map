<h2><strong>Introduction: a synthetic multicellular system to deliver a therapeutic &quot;cargo&quot;</strong></h2>

<p>This app demonstrates how simple &quot;rules&quot; for chemical- and contact-based communication could be used for <em>active</em> delivery of therapeutic compounds, while overcoming traditional biotransport limits and using hypoxia to target delivery. It is based on a published PhysiCell example in Ghaffarizadeh et al. (2018) [1]. In this model, <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green;">cancer cells (green)</span> rapidly divide while consuming oxygen, which drives the emergence of hypoxic gradients. Greater availability of oxygen drives faster proliferation, while low oxygen can trigger necrotic death, creating a necrotic core (<span style="font-weight: bold; color: breown;">brown cells</span>) in the center of the tumor. After initial growth, we &quot;inject&quot; a multicellular synthetic therapy.</p>

<p>In this (for now theoretical) synthetic therapy, <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">&quot;worker cells&quot; (red)</span> search for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue;">&quot;cargo cells&quot; (blue)</span>, form focal adhesions, and haul their cargo towards hypoxic (oxygen-depleted) regions in the tissue. Once they reach a region of sufficiently low oxygen, they release their cargo and resume their initial search for more cargo. Released cargo cells secrete a chemotherapeutic compound that can kill nearby tumor cells. (Cancer cells are shaded according to their level of therapy-induced damage.)</p>

<p>This model and cloud-hosted demo are part of a course on computational multicellular systems biology created and taught by Dr. Paul Macklin in the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering at Indiana University. It is also part of the education and outreach for the IU Engineered nanoBIO Node and the NCI-funded cancer systems biology grant U01CA232137. The models are built using <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991">PhysiCell</a>: a C++ framework for multicellular systems biology [1].</p>
