<li><b>Out: Cell Plots</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output display of the cells</li>

This tool lets you visualize data that has been generated by a PhysiCell model.

<p>To view the cell plots, click the &quot;cell plots&quot; tab, and slide the bar to advance through simulation frames. 
Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;max&quot; field (maximum frame number) will increase, so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>To view the substrate fields, click the &quot;substrate plots&quot; tab, choose a substrate from the drop-down menu, 
and slide through the saved times. Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;max&quot; field (maximum frame number) will 
increase, so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>Note that you can download full simulation data for further exploration in your tools of choice.</p>
